AutoLISP Programs to Improve Drafting Efficiency

The files in this repository are AutoLISP files that provide automation 
of specific tasks in AutoCAD for myself and other drafters I work with. 
The language is a basic LISP variant that includes specific commands 
that integrate with AutoCAD and its functions.

The files are currently in an alpha state about to be moved into internal 
testing and revision based on user feedback. Also, some functions were 
implemented quickly to be ready for a demo for users and the company 
president. Thus, there is some revision needed to finish conforming to 
coding best practices like the MVP model, DRY, and basic efficiency, as 
well as to reduce redundancies in helper functions.

The eventual goal of the project is a set of useful, efficient, and user-
friendly programs that will improve drafting efficiency as much as 50% on 
simple projects and assist with the speed of all projects. 

(The projects referenced above are architectural railing projects for 
everything from small residences to large commercial buildings. The
drawings for each project typically include layout plans, elevations, 
details, and a bill of materials.)
