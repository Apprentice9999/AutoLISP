AutoLISP Programs to Improve Drafting Efficiency

The files in this repository are AutoLISP files that provide automation 
of specific tasks in AutoCAD for myself and other my drafting coworkers. 
The language is a basic LISP variant that includes specific commands 
that integrate with AutoCAD and its functions.

The files are currently in an alpha state about to be moved into internal 
testing and revision based on user feedback. Also, some functions were 
implemented quickly to be ready for a demo for users and the company 
president. Thus, there is some revision needed to finish conforming to 
coding best practices like the MVP model, DRY, and basic efficiency, as 
well as to reduce redundancies in helper functions.

The eventual goal of the project is a set of useful, efficient, and user-
friendly programs that will improve drafting efficiency as much as 50% on 
simple projects and assist with the speed of all projects. 

(The projects referenced above are architectural railing projects for 
everything from small residences to large commercial buildings. The
drawings for each project typically include layout plans, elevations, 
details, and a bill of materials.)



As part of this project, I learned AutoLISP from scratch - never having even 
seen LISP before. Over the course of two months working about 3 hours per 
week - so as not to interfere with my daily duties - I learned the language, 
developed the programs in this repository, and demoed them for other users 
in the company with very positive feedback. The total work for the project 
has only been about 24 man hours do date.

I look forward to improving the programs through user testing and feedback 
in a very iterative and continual improvement process. It's really fun to 
have found a way to use my programming skills in my current drafting job.
