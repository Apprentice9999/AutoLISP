#AutoLISP (Professional Coding Experience)

-Project Overview-

The files in this repository are AutoLISP files that provide automation 
of specific tasks in AutoCAD for myself and my drafting coworkers. 
The language is a basic LISP variant that includes specific commands 
that integrate with AutoCAD and its functions.

The files are constantly being revised and will be moved into internal 
testing and revision based on user feedback when possible. Some functions were 
implemented quickly to be ready for a demo for users and the company 
president. Thus, there is some revision needed to finish conforming to 
coding best practices like the MVP model, DRY, and basic efficiency, as 
well as to reduce redundancies in helper functions.

The eventual goal of the project is a set of useful, efficient, and user-
friendly programs that will improve drafting efficiency as much as 100% on 
simple projects and assist with the speed of all projects. 

(The projects referenced above are architectural railing projects for 
everything from small residences to large commercial buildings. The
drawings for each project typically include layout plans, elevations, 
details, and a bill of materials.)


-Personal Improvement and Initiative-

As part of this project, I learned AutoLISP from scratch - never having 
seen LISP before. Over the course of two months working about 3 hours per 
week - so as not to interfere with my daily duties - I learned the language, 
developed the initial programs in this repository, and demoed them for other 
users in the company with positive feedback. The total work for the project 
has been less that 100 man hours as of 6/24/16 (it's been about nine months
since the project began).

I look forward to improving the programs through user testing and feedback 
in a very iterative and continually improving process. It's rewarding being
able to use my programming skills in my current drafting job - not something 
I expected.


-Other Info-

Files in the "3rd Party" folder are written by others and used by permission
- primarily to help me learn new techiques or commands in the language.

The "Old" folder has stubs of previous coding. Most of it has been revised and
simplified and moved to a newer file. I'm retaining it for refecence - there 
are some functions in the works that will use pieces of that old code.

Items in the "Related" folder include items that aren't AutoLISP code, but are 
important to retain; custom AutoCAD menu code and a Notepad++ AutoLISP language 
file are two examples.'
